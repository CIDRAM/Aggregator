=== VERSIONING GUIDELINES ===
Aggregator adheres to the SemVer guidelines for versioning.

Versioning guidelines for SemVer can be found at: https://semver.org/

=== Changes made since last versioned release ===

- [2021.10.30; Maikuolan]: Code-style cleanup: Public before private
  properties, magic before public before private methods.

- [2022.05.18; Maikuolan]: Split the methods for expanding CIDRs out to their
  own trait.

=== Version/Release 1.3.3 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2021.10.23; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Aggregating a single IP address with its
  own CIDR equivalent (i.e., a range containing just one IP address) produced
  output with a wider than expected range; Fixed.

=== Version/Release 1.3.2 ===
MAINTENANCE RELEASE.

- [2020.12.04; Maikuolan]: Ditched external test frameworks in favour of GitHub

=== Version/Release 1.3.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2020.01.11; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Syntactically invalid IPv6 addresses could
  be potentially accepted or produced by the aggregator in some obscure
  circumstances due an insufficiently bound regular expression; Fixed.

- [2020.01.14; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Due to some lines mistakenly removed in an
  earlier commit (2019.12.12), NumberEntered was failing to populate, therefore
  causing erroneous result values to be reported when aggregating; Fixed.
  Thanks to nistorj for reporting this bug.

- [2020.01.27; Maikuolan]: Removed public member Input (wasn't used anywhere in
  the code and was basically pointless). Added the ability to pass an array to
  the aggregate method (whether the passed parameter is a string or an array is
  now checked by stripInvalidCharactersAndSort, instead of it being assumed).

- [2020.06.11; Maikuolan]: Slightly improved some PHPDoc annotations.

=== Version/Release 1.3.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2019.12.12; Maikuolan]: Added some callable hooks to the IP aggregator to
  assist with benchmarking and progress reporting in some contexts (e.g., CLI).

- [2019.12.23; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The IP aggregator was able to successfully
  capture IPs and CIDRs contained within comments, but it should be ignoring
  comments entirely; Fixed.

=== Version/Release 1.2.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2018.05.16; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Slightly refactored the
  expressions used for expanding IP addresses.

- [2019.01.09; Maikuolan]: Aggregator now sorts its input differently, as such
  that IPv4 and IPv6 output isn't thoroughly mixed together anymore. Aggregator
  now supports netmasks, both as input and as output.

Caleb M (Maikuolan),
January 9, 2019.

=== Version/Release 1.1.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2017.10.08; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Refactored code.

- [2017.10.12; Minor code change; MASNathan]: Added the CIDRAM\Aggregator
  namespace. Added a helper function (helpers.php). Fixed PSR-4 autoloader
  issues, fixed tests, and fixed PHPUnit implementation.
