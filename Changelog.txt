=== VERSIONING GUIDELINES ===
Aggregator adheres to the SemVer guidelines for versioning.

Versioning guidelines for SemVer can be found at: https://semver.org/

=== Changes made since last versioned release ===

- [2019.12.12; Maikuolan]: Added some callable hooks to the IP aggregator to
  assist with benchmarking and progress reporting in some contexts (e.g., CLI).

- [2019.12.23; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The IP aggregator was able to successfully
  capture IPs and CIDRs contained within comments, but it should be ignoring
  comments entirely; Fixed.

=== Version/Release 1.2.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2018.05.16; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Slightly refactored the
  expressions used for expanding IP addresses.

- [2019.01.09; Maikuolan]: Aggregator now sorts its input differently, as such
  that IPv4 and IPv6 output isn't thoroughly mixed together anymore. Aggregator
  now supports netmasks, both as input and as output.
