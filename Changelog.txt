Aggregator Changelog.

=== VERSIONING GUIDELINES ===
Aggregator adheres to the SemVer guidelines for versioning.

Versioning guidelines for SemVer can be found at: https://semver.org/

=== Changes made since last versioned release ===

- [2024.06.25; Maikuolan]: A very minor performance improvement.

- [2024.08.02; Maikuolan]: Fixed some typos.

- [2024.10.14]: Strictened typing for the aggregator.

=== Version/Release 1.3.4 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2021.10.30; Maikuolan]: Code-style cleanup: Public before private
  properties, magic before public before private methods.

- [2022.05.18; Maikuolan]: Split the methods for expanding CIDRs out to their
  own trait.

- [2022.05.25; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Should add to, rather than replace, the
  numbers counted by the aggregator, and use only resetNumbers to reset those
  numbers explicitly, due to the risk of wrong final values being presented for
  split/tagged operations; Fixed.

- [2022.12.09; Maikuolan]: Avoid packaging unnecessary files into dist.

- [2023.08.03; Bug-fix; neufeind]: The aggregator's constructTables method was
  constructing the wrong IPv6 netmask for the last octet; Fixed.

=== Version/Release 1.3.3 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2021.10.23; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Aggregating a single IP address with its
  own CIDR equivalent (i.e., a range containing just one IP address) produced
  output with a wider than expected range; Fixed.

=== Version/Release 1.3.2 ===
MAINTENANCE RELEASE.

- [2020.12.04; Maikuolan]: Ditched external test frameworks in favour of GitHub
  Actions. Replaced existing tests.

=== Version/Release 1.3.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2020.01.11; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Syntactically invalid IPv6 addresses could
  be potentially accepted or produced by the aggregator in some obscure
  circumstances due an insufficiently bound regular expression; Fixed.

- [2020.01.14; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Due to some lines mistakenly removed in an
  earlier commit (2019.12.12), NumberEntered was failing to populate, therefore
  causing erroneous result values to be reported when aggregating; Fixed.
  Thanks to nistorj for reporting this bug.

- [2020.01.27; Maikuolan]: Removed public member Input (wasn't used anywhere in
  the code and was basically pointless). Added the ability to pass an array to
  the aggregate method (whether the passed parameter is a string or an array is
  now checked by stripInvalidCharactersAndSort, instead of it being assumed).

- [2020.06.11; Maikuolan]: Slightly improved some PHPDoc annotations.

=== Version/Release 1.3.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2019.12.12; Maikuolan]: Added some callable hooks to the IP aggregator to
  assist with benchmarking and progress reporting in some contexts (e.g., CLI).

- [2019.12.23; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The IP aggregator was able to successfully
  capture IPs and CIDRs contained within comments, but it should be ignoring
  comments entirely; Fixed.

=== Version/Release 1.2.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2018.05.16; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Slightly refactored the
  expressions used for expanding IP addresses.

- [2019.01.09; Maikuolan]: Aggregator now sorts its input differently, as such
  that IPv4 and IPv6 output isn't thoroughly mixed together anymore. Aggregator
  now supports netmasks, both as input and as output.

=== Version/Release 1.1.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2017.10.08; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Refactored code.

- [2017.10.12; Minor code change; MASNathan]: Added the CIDRAM\Aggregator
  namespace. Added a helper function (helpers.php). Fixed PSR-4 autoloader
  issues, fixed tests, and fixed PHPUnit implementation.
